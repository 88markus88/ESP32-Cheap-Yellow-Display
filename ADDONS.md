# Add-Ons

Here is a list of aditional hardware add-ons that can add funcitonality to your CYD

## Speakers

A speaker can be attached to the display with a 1.25mm JST connector to the connector labled "SPEAK" (or soldered)

Check out the [HelloRadio](/Examples/Basics/7-HelloRadio) example for the code on how to use it.

Most small 8 Ohm speakers should work. Maybe worth adding a 1.25mm JST connector to it to make it easy to add remove.
